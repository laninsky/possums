IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 214 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 17 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.


Just in case you might need it, a mixed model file with 
model assignments for undetermined columns removed is printed to file partition_file.reduced
Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file concatenated_codon_partitioned_protein_coding_genes.phy.reduced

Alignment has 17 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data



This is RAxML version 8.2.12 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on May 2018.

Alignment has 581 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.25%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 3 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
