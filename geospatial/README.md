## Geospatial analyses of mitogenome clades

### Converting coordinates to decimal long/lat
We received the geographic locations for some samples in New Zealand Transverse Mercator Projection. For displaying on maps with R packages, these were converted to decimal long/lat (New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000 (version 20180701)), using https://www.geodesy.linz.govt.nz/concord/index.cgi

For some samples, a verbal description of location was given, and an approximate long/lat was obtained from google maps.
